          <h3><em>SNAPPING THE REPEATED MISCREANT USING QR CODES</h3>
        </a></strong></em>
    </P>
    <p>The purpose of this research paper is to make a comparative study and to establish a network of Quick Response (QR) Code driving licenses and snapping the repeated miscreant using QR Codes i.e. safeguard common man's safety by allowing only
      adept and sincere riders without repeated offences to be there on roads riding their respective vehicles. The QR Codes on a single scanning will link you to a temporary link that will give you the entire identity including the name, address and
      photograph which shall be upgraded later with fingerprint and signature as well as car details. A database would be connected to the QR Codes easily made online using kaywa. com, Open Source Code, PHP or Google's new QR CODE generator or manual
      updation of data using SQL using Android Studio and the database will be updated repeatedly whenever a person commits an offence related to breaking traffic or a link will lead to a page where all the database of the driver will be uploaded and
      a repeated offender will have his driving license seized or a hefty fine imposed or maybe put behind bars if a certain offence limit is crossed. There shall be certain levels which will differentiate a good driver to an irresponsive one.</p>
